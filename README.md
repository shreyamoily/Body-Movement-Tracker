# Body-Movement-Tracker
A web application which tracks the change in body (skeletal recognition) and stores database information regarding the full movement of the body with the help of motion capture technology. Calibration of human body parts means identifying the 3D position of the body joints of a human. 

## Tech Stack

### Hardware
- Web Cam
- GPU (Optional)
### Software
- Python
- Tensorflow
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## Features
-  A web application that uses motion capture technology to track and analyze body movements in real-time.
- Stores database information of the motion using opencv and matplotlib.
- Performs live and video calibration to accurately determine the 3D positions of human joints.
